# Implementation of Digital Image Processing to Electrophoresis Image for Identification of DNA Bands with OpenCV in Python.

Abstract— Electrophoresis is a process of electrochemical breakdown of DNA bands in which the RNA / DNA protein fragments are made to move in a gel medium that is flowed by a current. Gel Electrophoresis itself is one of the most commonly used techniques due to the wide field of use of this technique. Digital image processing and pattern recognition techniques can be used to extract qualitative and quantitative information from an image. In addition, digital image processing can overcome human errors that may occur from manual analysis. This article will explain the implementation of digital image processing from the results of electrophoretic images to identify protein sequences in DNA bands using OpenCV in Python. The process of digital image processing from electrophoresis is carried out by thresholding, Contrast Limited AHE (CLAHE), morphology, searching for the contour and midpoint of the band, and comparing the bands to the reference bands in the lane ladder.

Keywords— Electrophoresis, OpenCV, Python.
